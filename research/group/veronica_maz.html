                <p>Veronica Mazariegos-Anastassiou is a second year M.S. student in the Dyson School of Applied Economic and Management, concentrating in food and agriculture economics. Veronica received her bachelor’s degree from New York University in International Relations and Economics, where she focused on development economics.</p>
                <p>She served as a Peace Corps volunteer in Togo, where she worked alongside rice farmers as a business/cooperative extension agent and farmhand. It was there where she realized she wanted to dedicate herself to farming, supporting farmers, and improving access to nutritious food. She went on to work at Social Impact, a management consulting firm in Arlington, VA in the Impact Evaluation practice on a diverse portfolio of projects including a randomized control trial of a USAID-funded youth empowerment project in Guatemala and Honduras and meta-analyses of agriculture interventions for USDA FAS. She then decided to pursue farming full-time in California, first as an apprentice farmer and later becoming a farm manager at Pie Ranch, an educational non-profit farm. She oversaw the vegetable production to directly supply large institutional buyers in the San Francisco Bay area. She now splits her time between Ithaca, NY and Pescadero, CA ,where she co-owns and co-manages a small organic farm, Brisa de Año Ranch, with her husband and a friend.</p>
                <p>She is interested in analyzing the space between the farmer and the consumer and how the changing landscape of farming affects the decision on what food we grow, how food is marketed, and how and what we eat.</p>
                <p>Aside from her research and farming, she spends her time getting creative in the kitchen, running, hiking, practicing yoga, and collecting frequent flier miles. </p>
