                <p>Growing up in an Italian-American family, Maria has always perceived food as a precious source of nourishment, community, and power. At the same time, her fascination for the natural world and sense of social justice has propelled her desire to defend the Earth and its people. To integrate her passions for food, the environment, and equity, she is studying International Agriculture and Rural Development with a concentration in Economics and Development in CALS. Maria particularly hopes to search for the social and economic structures that encourage development while maintaining diversity among the environment, people, and traditions of countries to promote more vibrant and sustainable food systems worldwide.</p>
                <p>To engage with her passions, Maria is the Outreach Chair for Cornell Hunger Relief, leading communications between the group and food networks in Tompkins County to help combat local food insecurity, and the Events Chair for Crème de Cornell, in which she uses the power of food to build community on campus. She was also selected for the Cargill Global Scholars Program in recognition of her potential for global leadership. Beyond academics, she enjoys cooking, painting, spending time outside, reading, listening to music, and getting coffee with friends.</p>
