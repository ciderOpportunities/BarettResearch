                <p>Hi! My name is Nima, I’m currently a first year Master’s in AEM and I’m hoping to do more work in development, especially focusing on the efficacy of food assistance programs in low and middle income countries. I did my undergraduate at the University of Illinois where I studied agricultural economics and did research about the potential welfare effects of in-kind food aid on producers in aid recipient countries. Over the summer of 2018 I worked at the Land Institute where I learned a lot about efforts to breed and market perennial grains, which has become a field of research I’d like to explore more, especially adapted to agricultural extension work in developing countries. A fun fact about me is I bake bread almost every week and used to play competitive water polo!</p>
