                <p>Casey Goldvale is a senior from Washington, D.C., studying Economics and Mathematics in the College of Arts and Sciences. She first became interested in social-justice oriented economics through her work with the Cornell Organization for Labor Action (COLA). COLA supports fair treatment of workers by strategically using Cornell’s leverage as a consumer over brands that violate legally protected worker rights. This experience in international supply chain economics led her to development economics, which she has explored through extracurricular groups and research, academics, field work in Ecuador, and, now, working with Dr. Barrett’s team. The development field is especially exciting to her because it is one of the most interdisciplinary fields of economics, allowing her to address many issues she finds important, such as inequality, labor, environmental sustainability, and public finance.</p>
                <p>When she isn’t working on economics, Casey enjoys visual arts, exploring beautiful places, and spending time in the Von Cramm Cooperative, where she is House Manager.</p>
