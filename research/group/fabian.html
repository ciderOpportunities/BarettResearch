                <p>Fabian is a PhD student at Cornell University in the Department of Animal Science, specializing in
                    Dairy Science and Nutrition. His research interests focus on understanding and improving fatty acid
                    digestibility as a strategy to improve feed efficiency and reduce the environmental impact of dairy
                    farms. He is passionate about developing and implementing technologies to enhance livestock systems'
                    sustainability and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
                <p>Fabian completed his Doctor of Veterinary Medicine in 2021 from the University of Tolima, Colombia,
                    where he was actively involved in ruminant nutrition research and extension during his degree. He
                    also worked as a research intern at the University of Georgia before coming to Cornell.</p>
