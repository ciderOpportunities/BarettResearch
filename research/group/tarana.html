                <p>Tarana Chauhan is a second year Ph.D. student at the Charles H. Dyson School of Applied Economics and
                    Management, Cornell University. She is currently studying the unequal effects on development that
                    result from political motivations. She is interested in a variety of problems such as female labor
                    force participation and effects of air pollution in developing countries and is hoping to engage
                    more on research in the areas of development interlinked with labor, environment and behavioral
                    economics. <br>
                    In the past, she has worked with the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) and the
                    Population Council as a research analyst, immersing extensively in questions of maternal and child
                    health and nutrition, and women’s reproductive health. She has also worked on issues of urban
                    transport systems, and draws from all these experiences in her projects and proposals at Cornell.
                    <br>
                    In the recent few months, she has been engrossed with learning new programming languages such as
                    Python, Julia and Google Earth Engine. In the limited time the PhD allows her to spare, she likes to
                    spend it dancing, travelling, listening to music and fawning over animals.
