                <p>Kibrom is a graduate student at the Dyson School of Applied Economics and Management. His research interests include the role of internal constraints of the poor in overcoming the state of their poverty, and the effects of shocks and insurance on subjective wellbeing. He studies the links between aspirations and wealth in poor communities in rural Ethiopia. More specifically, he explores the ways in which aspirations interact with risk preference, time preference, and motivation to influence wealth outcomes. Kibrom is also investigating the productivity implications of crop diversification in Africa using multi-country longitudinal data. He is working to understand the sources of these productivity effects.</p>
                <p>Kibrom received BA in Economics in 2004, and MS in International Economics in 2008 from Addis Ababa University, Ethiopia. Before joining the PhD program, Kibrom worked at IFPRI Addis Ababa office as a research assistant. In his free time, Kibrom enjoys playing soccer, watching European soccer league games, and listening music.</p>
