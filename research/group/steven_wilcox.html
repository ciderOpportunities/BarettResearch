                <p>Steven Wilcox is a 6 th year PhD student in Applied Economics and Management at Cornell. His
                    research is focused on food and agricultural systems, natural resources, development and the
                    intersection of these topics. Steve’s current projects touch on a variety of ideas in this space,
                    including land use change and commodity prices, environmental impacts from index insurance,
                    and farmer pollination choices.</p>
                <p>Before coming to Cornell, Steve worked for over ten years in natural resource management and
                    agriculture with geographic focus in the Intermountain West and Latin America. He has worked
                    for non-profit conservation organizations in Central America, the US Forest Service, the Utah
                    Division of Wildlife Resources, and the USDA Natural Resources Conservation service. In these
                    capacities his work spanned a variety of agricultural and natural systems, involved frequent
                    work with multidisciplinary teams on policy development and project implementation, and
                    extensive work with private landowners on projects ranging from enhancing agricultural
                    productivity to ecological restoration.</p>
                <p>Outside of research, Steve spends the majority of this time with his wife and two kids. He also
                    stays busy with a variety of hobbies – including music and various forms of outdoor adventure
                    involving fish and flies, backpacks and skis, and various forms of climbing.</p>
