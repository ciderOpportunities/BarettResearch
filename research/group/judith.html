                <p>Judith Martin is a second year MS student in the Dyson School of Applied Economics and Management,
                    with focus in International and Development Economics. Her research interests center on the food
                    insecurity dynamics in the United States utilizing data from the Current Population Survey. <br>
                    Last summer (’19), she interned with the Tata Cornell Institute in New Delhi, examining the time
                    allocation of women in rural India. She went on to participate in the SMART program of the Emerging
                    Markets Program in the Charles H. Dyson School, traveling to Uganda to assist the social enterprise
                    Golden Bees Ltd. in expanding and strengthening operations and production efforts, and to increase
                    their visibility in the market. Prior to attending Cornell, she earned a Bachelor’s degree in
                    Agricultural Economics and Political Science from Purdue University. While at Purdue she worked in a
                    laboratory for specialty crop production systems where she managed research trials on hops and was
                    involved in extension and outreach programs. </p>
