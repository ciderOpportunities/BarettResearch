                <p>Ezgi (she/her) is a junior at the Dyson School of Applied Economics and Management from
                    Turkey. She is concentrating on International Trade and Development with a minor in French.
                    Witnessing the democratic backsliding, rural underdevelopment, and stagflation in Turkey, she has
                    always been interested in sustainably solving the underlying societal issues and thereby grew a
                    passion for improving global and rural development to increase the welfare and living standards of
                    socio-economically disadvantaged groups. Her other interests include economic policy, gender
                    equality, international law, environmentalism, and climate change.</p>

                <p>To explore and internalize her interests at the local level as well, she is helping create local climate
                    projects as the Vice Curator of the Ithaca Hub of the Global Shapers community, an initiative by the
                    World Economic Forum. In addition to being the New Member Educator of the government &amp;
                    policy pre-professional fraternity (POLIS) on campus, she is also helping the research of the
                    Emerging Markets Institute on country rankings with respect to Sustainable Development Goals. In
                    her free time, she loves acting, watching theatre plays, doing Latin dances, reading, playing the cello,
                    and listening to rock music.</p>
