                    My research aims to understand links among environmental change and human health. I focus on the ways resource access impedes or provides for food, livelihood, and nutrition security, and how human well-being feeds back to affect environmental sustainability. I combine my training as an ecologist and epidemiologist with interdisciplinary methods from economics, political ecology and sociology.

                    <h4>Livelihood, food and nutrition security</h4>

                    I lead a research project that explores the coupled human and natural system of Lake Victoria to address links between environmental change and livelihood, food and nutrition security. I combine community-based ecological monitoring of fish catch and household survey data to analyze how declining fish availability affects local households. Initial results for this project have shown that involvement in fishing does not necessarily contribute to higher food security or fish consumption and explored how fishery management shapes patterns of local fish consumption.

                    <h4>Livelihood shocks, illness, and natural resources</h4>
                    
                    My research also seeks to understand the role of social ills as a response to and cause of environmental change. At a global scale, this work addresses pathways between wildlife decline and social conflict. At a local scale, work around Lake Victoria explores the effects of fishery decline on the transactional fish-for-sex economy and links between fisher illness and fishing practices, particularly their legality and sustainability.

                    <br><br>

                    My past work experience at the UN World Food Programme in Kampala, Uganda, and The Food Project in Boston, MA, USA focused on related themes of environmental change, food access, and nutrition. My training includes a Ph.D. in Environmental Science, Policy and Management and Masters of Public Health (Epidemiology) from the University of California, Berkeley, and an A.B. in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from Princeton University.
