                <p>Adamon is primarily interested with the economics of food price shocks in developing countries in general, and particularly in Uganda with a threefold objective.  Firstly, he seeks to understand the welfare consequences of large food price changes on households within an environment characterized by important market imperfections (for example labor market failures) and household heterogeneity.  Secondly, he intends to analyze households’ responses to these changes of crop prices by focusing on the dynamics of crop choices, labor supply, and income generating activities.  Finally, he studies the links between large food price changes and persistent poverty. More specifically, he is investigating the ways in which households’ strategies to cope with food price shocks might contribute to helping them move out poverty or instead to exarcebating the risk of being trapped into poverty.</p>
                <p>Adamon received a BA in Economics in 2005, an MA in Financial Management in 2008 from the Catholic University of Bukavu, DR Congo. He also got an MS in Local Development and Poverty Reduction in 2011 from the Institute of Development Policy and Management of the University of Antwerp, Belgium. He currently is a third year PhD student at the department of Economics and Management of the University of Trento, Italy. In this free time, he enjoys reading, watching football games, and listening music.</p>
