                <p>Anannyabrata is an undergraduate student at Cornell University, double majoring in Economics and Statistical Sciences, with a double minor in Business and International Trade and Development. He comes from India and Côte d’Ivoire, and his experiences growing up in these countries (as well as Togo and South Africa) has helped shape his passions. Hailing from an agrarian family himself, and observing the plight of cocoa farmers in Côte d’Ivoire in-person, during one of his projects, he is dedicated in positively contributing to the sustainable development of Global South economies and the improvement of farmers’ lives worldwide. He has done internships with farmers’ cooperatives and exporters in Côte d'Ivoire, where he worked with the cocoa farmers there on sustainable cocoa cultivation.</p>
                
                <p>On campus, you can find him involved with the community in his roles as a Resident Advisor and a Peer Ambassador, while also commentating games on ESPN+, for Cornell’s varsity soccer teams, among other involvements. He also maintains his involvement in the fields of economics and global development as President of the Cornell Economics Society, and the Emerging Markets Society. In his free time, Anannyabrata enjoys travelling (visited 40+ countries), expanding on his stock of seven languages, walking along Ithaca’s trails, reading thrillers, listening to music, and playing soccer and tennis.</p>
