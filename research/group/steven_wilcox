                <p>Steven is from the Western United States (Utah and Arizona) and couldn’t resist the
                opportunity to migrate east for a spell to earn a PhD in applied economics at Cornell.
                He has a BA from Utah State University (cum laude, 2002; major in American
                Studies, minors in Geology and Spanish) and an MS in environmental policy (Bard
                College, 2005).</p>
                <p>As an applied economist, Steven’s research interests are in the economics of
                development, agriculture, natural resources, and welfare. He works on projects that
                treat each subject area individually, but also enjoys research projects that manage to
                examine the intersection of these subject areas in novel ways. Examples of current
                work include research on welfare and staple food prices, and the spatiotemporal
                variability of food security and weather.</p>
                <p>Prior to Cornell, Steven worked for over ten years in natural resource management
                in various roles primarily in the Western U.S. This included stints as a forester in
                the Greater Yellowstone region (with Montana State University and US Forest
                Service), and as a habitat biologist in Utah working directly with farmers to improve
                on-farm natural resource conservation (with both the USDA-NRCS and the Utah
                Department of Wildlife Resources). He has also had research and work experience
                in Costa Rica (forest conservation on the Osa Peninsula with Proyecto Campanario)
                and Mexico (wetland and shorebird conservation with IWJV).</p>
                <p>In his spare time Steven enjoys spending time with his family (wife Sasha, kids Axel
                and Wren), playing music, and engaging in various forms of outdoor recreation.</p>
