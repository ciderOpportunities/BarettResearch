                <p> Farnaz is a Research Assistant in the Charles H. Dyson School of Applied Economics
                    and Management at Cornell.<br>

                    holding a master’s degree in Finance.<br>
                    Her intense interest in learning economics, more profoundly along with her family
                    background of growing up on a farm, intrigued her to study for another master’s
                    degree in Agricultural and Resource Economics, this time from the University of
                    California, Davis.<br>
                    She started working as an RA with the hope of fulfilling a lifelong dream of helping
                    developing countries, reducing poverty, and striving for a decent level of welfare
                    for everyone worldwide.<br>
                    Her research interests are agricultural and development economics, financial
                    development, and poverty.<br>
                    In her leisure time, she enjoys hiking with family and friends, reading and traveling.</p>
