                <p>Nathan Jensen received his PhD in Applied Economics and Management at Cornell University, where he is now a postdoc.  His dissertation research focused on the quality, uptake and impacts of an innovative index based livestock insurance product (IBLI) offered to pastoralists in northern Kenya.  His current research continues to focus on pastoral populations and tools for risk management, but has now broadened to also include the use of mobile technology to crowdsource vital local information, push and pull factors of livelihood transitions, and more general questions about technology adoption.</p>
                <p>Before coming to Cornell, Nathan spent two years in Mali as a Peace Corps Volunteer (‘05-’07) and two years at the University of Missouri pursuing his Masters in Agricultural and Applied Economics (’08-’10).  He has also spent time as a vegetable farmer, forest fire fighter, estate caretaker and day laborer. He enjoys spending time outside doing just about anything with his family.</p>
