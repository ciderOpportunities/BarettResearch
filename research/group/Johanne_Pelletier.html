        The goal of my research contribution is to improve our understanding of the impacts of
        human interactions with terrestrial ecosystems through land-use/cover change, with the
        goal of mitigating climate change, sustaining ecosystem services and improving the
        livelihoods of forest dependent people.<br><br>

        <h4>Current project:</h4>

        As part of the NatureNet Science Fellows Program, I will contribute to ongoing effort for
        halting climate change with a focus on sustainable energy, using Zambia as a case study.
        The main research question that I want to explore is: <b>Is it possible to sustainably manage
          wood energy supply in order to fulfil growing energy demand while promoting low-carbon development in Zambia now and in the future?</b> <br><br>

        In order to address this question, I will examine the socio-economic and ecological impacts of the wood energy value chain in Zambia, looking at both supply and demand using a multidisciplinary approach. To scale-up to the national scale, I
        will use remote sensing data and products, mostly based on very high resolution imagery. Using spatially explicit land use modelling, I will try to predict the impacts of future demand for wood fuel energy associated with population and
        income growth on forest cover change, GHG emissions and socio-economic development, and test different potential management alternatives and policy scenarios that could sustain biomass energy for the future, in order to contribute to low
        carbon development away from fossil fuel dependency and relevant to livelihoods in the SSA region.<br><br>

        <h4>Previous Projects:</h4>

        My previous research has focused on three main components. First, I have worked on <b><i>reducing uncertainty in carbon emissions and removals from land-use/cover change</i></b> in the context the mechanism for Reducing Emissions from
        Deforestation and forest Degradation in developing countries, under the United Nations Convention on Climate Change. Second, I have been interested in <b><i>understanding variations in carbon storage and biodiversity due to ecological and
            anthropogenic factors in different forest ecosystems</i></b>, including in Panama and in Zambia. Thirdly, I have also dedicated my effort at <b><i>providing evidence-based policy and management strategies to conserve forest and improve
            livelihoods</i></b>, on a project in the Democratic Republic of Congo, working with indigenous people in Panama and, globally. I obtained my PhD at McGill University (Canada) from a joint program with the Smithsonian Tropical Research
        Institute (Panama). Then, I have been a postdoctoral research fellow at the Woods Hole Research Center (now visitor scholar), with a leadership role on a project focusing on improving the accuracy of estimates of emissions and removals from
        land-cover change and supporting conservation in Southern and Eastern Africa.
