                <p>Andrew is interested in research that informs more intelligent decision making for policy makers and practioners in the international development sphere. Currently his research interests include an analysis of the Productive Safety Net Program in Ethiopia, and an experimental evaluation of fuel-efficient cook stove use and adoption behavior in southwestern Uganda.</p>
                <p>Andrew received a Master's of Public Administration in International Development from the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University in 2004. His thesis was on reducing maternal mortality in Afghanistan. Prior to his Master's degree, Andrew studied biology at Taylor University and spent time working on earthquake relief and rehabilitation in El Salvador in 2002.</p>
                <p>Before entering the PhD program, Andrew spent seven years working in Ethiopia and Honduras in various senior level NGO management positions. He is married to Laura Rodriguez and they have an amazing and energetic daughter named Isabella. Outside of family and work, Andrew is interested in all things related to baseball and is using his time in Ithaca to learn from the Cornell Lab of Ornithology to become an expert amateur birder.</p>
