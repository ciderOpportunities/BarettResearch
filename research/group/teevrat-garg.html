                <p>Teevrat is primarily concerned with the economics of environmental degradation in low and middle-income countries. In particular, he is understanding the link between food security, health and the provision of environmental public goods such as forests and coral reefs. One of his dissertation chapters provides the causal effect between deforestation and the outbreak of malaria using an instrumental variables approach on rich spatially disaggregated remote sensing and survey data covering over 40,000 villages in Indonesia.</p>
                <p>He is also working with an interdisciplinary team of professors and graduate students in Applied Economics, Ecology &amp; Evolutionary Biology and Earth & Atmospheric Sciences to analyze how food insecurity in coastal regions of Indonesia affects marine health. This is part of his broader research that examines the coupled dynamics of ecosystems and poverty traps.</p>
                <p>Teevrat graduated summa cum laude with a BS in Math and an AB in Economics (with Honors) from Lafayette College in Easton, PA. He was a national champion in intercollegiate speech and debate and his interest in policy debate motivated his decision to go to graduate school. When Teevrat isn't immersed in data and code, he likes to read, listen to music and play rugby, tennis and chess. He enjoys political discussions and is a fan of the West Wing. He has previously served as Chief of Staff, and Vice-President to the Graduate Student Association of the Dyson School.</p>
