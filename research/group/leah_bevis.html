                <p>Leah Bevis is interested in linked dynamics between human welfare and biophysical systems, a subject at the nexus of development, health, and resource/sustainability economics. Her job market paper examines how bio-physical constraints and smallholder supply choices relate to the nutrient content of crops found in rural Ugandan markets. Leah is also examining state-conditioned soil investment patterns within smallholder agriculture in Uganda, how agriculture and marketing decisions shape early childhood zinc intake, and how soils play into the inverse size productivity relationship in Uganda. She is also interested in the intergenerational transmission of human capital and income.</p>
                <p>Leah is a sixth year PhD candidate in the Dyson School of Applied Economics and Management, and a fellow of the Food Systems and Poverty Reduction IGERT program at Cornell University. She did her undergraduate degree at Middlebury College in Vermont where she majored in geography and minored in economics.</p>
                <p>Leah has been in and out of East Africa for about 10 years now, including a year spent in eastern Uganda running village-level health programs for a nonprofit organization called Uganda Village Project. In her spare time Leah enjoys running, yoga, and talking politics with friends. She also works in the local community garden, attempting to merge her academic knowledge of farming with the realities of her garden plot.
                <p>Leah is currently on the market, Fall 2015.</p>
