                taken/made March - July 2015 by 113 pastoralists in Northern Kenya while going about their daily lives.
                The contributors were asked to collect submissions as much as they liked, as long as those submissions
                were collected during daylight hours and were a minimum of 60 minutes apart. A submission entailed
                taking a photo of the landscape and then completing a short survey about the prevalence of trees, shrubs
                and grasses; the dominant color of the leaves/grasses for each, if occurring, and their palatability for
                livestock. In addition, participant provide a coarse estimate of the carrying capacity of the immediate
                area, types of animals grazing there, and distance to the nearest waterpoint. The project provided
                participants with a small token per submission.</li>
